## Introduction
This software prototype is my submission for IT5016 Software Development, Assignment 2: Your Software Project & Assignment 3: Reasearch Repository. This software that I've developed is a help-desk ticketing system for support staff and administrator use only.

## Features
**Login Screen**  
-**Authenticator**, The Help-Desk or IT Department Staff members need to input their username and password in order to gain access to their option screen, ensuring proper access control.

**Help Desk Department Option Screen**  
-**Create Ticket**, Users have the ability to create and submit a new support ticket for the IT Department to analyze.  
-**View Tickets**, With this option, the users can retrieve all created tickets for reference or review.  
-**Respond To Ticket**, Once the admins have resolved a particular ticket, users can provide additional feedback.  
-**Logout**, After the user has finished their task using this software, they can choose to log out from the software.  

**IT Department Option Screen**  
-**View Tickets**, Admins have the ability to gather the required information on all tickets for analysis and tracking purposes.  
-**Resolve Ticket**, This option allows administrators to respond to a submitted ticket and resolve the issue that coincides with the ticket. If a support staff requests a password, the admin can initiate an automatic generated password.  
-**Change Admin Password**, Administrators have the ability to change/alter their or another admins password.
-**Ticket Statistics**, This option retreives statistices based on ticket total, opened tickets, closed tickets.  
-**Reopen Ticket**, When a certain ticket is completed (*closed), Administrators have the access to reopen a particular ticket.  
-**Logout**, After the adminisrator has finished their task using this software, they can choose to log out from the software. 

## Technologies
This software is developed using:

[**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download#) `version: 1.82.3`  
[**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) `version: 3.11.0`  
[**Python Library**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html) `module: shutil`  

## Setup  
In order to begin working on this software, it is necessary to set up your development environment, which includes installing the widely used code editor, Visual Studio Code, as well as Python, which is utilized in this software.  
  

**Step 1: Installing Python**
1. **Download Python:**
   Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) and download this version or later for your specific operating system - Windows, macOS or Linux.
2. **Install Python:**
   Proceed with the installation by running the previously downloaded installer. Before proceeding, ensure that you check the box labeled "Add Python to PATH" for the installation.
3. **Verify Installation:**
   To execute the following command, open a command prompt on Windows or a terminal on macOS and Linux
   `python --version`
   The Python version should be displayed.
     
**Step 2: Installing Visual Studio Code**  
1. **Download Visual Studio Code:**  
   Visit the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download#) and download the installer for your specific operating system - Windows, macOS, or Linux.  
2. **Install Visual Studio Code:**  
   Please follow the installation instructions that are provided on the website for your particular operating system.
3. **Open Visual Studio Code:**  
   After successfully installing Visual Studio Code, you can launch the application.

 **Step 3: Accessing Software Files in Visual Studio Code**  
1. To open Visual Studio Code, click on the application icon.  
2. To open a folder:  
    *1.* Click on the "File" menu located in the top-left corner.  
    *2.* If you are working with a workspace, select "Add Folder to Workspace". If you are not using a workspace, select "Open Folder...".    
    *3.* Browse to the location of the downloaded software folder and click "Open". Alternatively, you can also drag and drop your project folder directly into the Visual Studio Code window.
3. After opening the folder, you will find a file explorer on the left sidebar. This allows you to navigate through the files.    
4. To access the `Help-Desk-Ticketing-System-Prototype` software in the terminal:  
   *1.* To begin using the software, double click on `main.py` file in the file explorer.
5. Run python file:
